## 🚀 Starting

This repository contains [the final project](https://github.com/mateusadada/sop-udesc/blob/main/final_project/escalonadores_Look_e_C-Look.py) from Operating System course in the third semester. An algorithm in Python was created to compare the Look and C-Look process schedulers through a graphical representation. I used an example of a hard drive (HD) where the levels/blocks range from 0 to 999. For each scheduler, I organized two lists:

1. Numbers that are equal to or greater than 500.
2. The remaining numbers.

Then, I utilized the [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) library for their intersection and the generation of the graph.

It was fundamental to improve my knowledge in this language and it also helped with my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems at [UDESC](https://www.udesc.br/).

## 📚 Features

Used during the evolution of course and the final project:

- Introduction to Operating Systems.
- Multiprogramming.
- Concurrent programming.
- Process management.
- Memory management.
- Input and output management.
- File system.
- Study of the major Operating Systems.
